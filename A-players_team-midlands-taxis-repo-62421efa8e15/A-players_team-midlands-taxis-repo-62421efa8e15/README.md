MIDLANDS TAXIS project instructions

1. Get the clone project repository URL from Bitbucket, using the "Clone" button

2. Paste it into a terminal (command line) to clone the repository locally, on your machine.
You should have a repo called "midlands-taxis-repo". Inside the repo you should find:
a) the project folder, called "midlands-taxis"
b) a file called "contributors.txt"
c) and this README.md document (the one you are reading now).

3. Once the project is cloned, open it in Eclipse, by following the next steps:
a) In Eclipse, choose File / Import / General / Existing Projects into Workspace / next / in the "Import Projects" window you should select the root directory by pressing "Browse" and choose the path to the local repo created on your machine / Finish.
This means you import the project from your local machine into Eclipse.

4. Project explorer.
There would be our 2 main folders (ignore the other 4, those are generated automatically by Eclipse):
a) Java Resources - here will be our Java work
b) Web Content - here you should be able to see a css and HTML folder, with some dummy inserted text now, for test purposes.


5. Project run.
a) Find in the WebContent / html / index.html
b) Run as / Run on Server / in the displayed window choose Apache / Tomcat v7.0 Server / next /
c) here you should browse the path to the installed Tomcat you have on your machine (same we did in class, Martina)
Make sure you have the Tomcat v7.0 installed on your machine!
d) Finish. Here you should get displayed the message "Welcome to Midlands Taxis!".
This means the project has been set up correctly.
